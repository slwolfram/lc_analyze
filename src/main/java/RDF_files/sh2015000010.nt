The trigger film's method is that of creating a dramatic dilemma (usually staged) that is centered on a timely issue such as teenage drug use, and then ending the film before the dramatic situation is resolved. This open-ended approach is intended to trigger discussion among audience members about the nature of the dilemma and its possible resolution. The trigger-film concept originated in the 1960s at the University of Michigan in a series of films designed for discussion of problems related to highway safety.

It is often presented in elementary and middle school classrooms and carry themes that are often about subjective topics such as morality, ethics, and safety. The movies often carry a loose, disconnected, plot that intentionally lacks a conclusion or even a moral. Trigger films are usually very short and only have a few scenes. They are usually not accompanied by narration or any prologue (except, perhaps, to introduce the situation), instead the audience only observes the characters' behaviors and actions. The intention of a trigger film is to \"trigger\" a discussion about the short scenes presented in the movie and how the characters reacted to the situation, and how each viewer would handle that situation differently. The teacher often serves as a mediator, perhaps offering his or her own insights, but most of the discussion is left to the students. Note that unlike \"non-trigger\" educational films about similar topics, there is no narration of what the student is doing, nor does it conclude that the student was caught and subsequently disciplined nor does it disclose if the student got a good or bad grade on the test. The film instead tries to trigger the audience to come to its own conclusions of whether it was right or wrong to copy off someone's test and whether, if the viewer was in the place of the protagonist, they would have done the same thing. Trigger films are not only used in grade school, but also in colleges and universities; especially those curricula that greatly involve ethics, such as medical fields, law enforcement, business, and public relations)"@en .
