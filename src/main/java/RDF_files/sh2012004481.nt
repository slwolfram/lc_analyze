Spoken Word was basically a catch-all category to lump together anything that didn't fit into the already well established categories of performance: Music, Theatre & Dance. Some word performance art had been around for eons--storytelling, sound-emphasis poetry, African American toasting, reggae riddims--these forms just hadn't received much attention and suddenly the well-educated acknowledged the exclusion, suddenly people felt politically incorrect. For the sake of scholarly study & to secure federal arts funding, however, academia seems to have settled on a definition: Spoken Word is a category of performance art to encompass any new seriously developed genre or traditional form that is primarily word-based & is not exclusively Music, Theatre or Dance but may include collaborations with other non-word-based art genres or works created in collaboration with artists from non-word-based disciplines.)"@en .

The current wave of Spoken Word poets are largely minority artists, and their poetic \"voices\" speak of specific cultural identities, whether connected with race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality. Quite often, the poetic speaker is nearly indistinguishable from the performing poet's body on stage, as the poet stands up before the audience to embody a local (and often bilingual) identity and to defend it against immense pressures to assimilate. Although Spoken Word artists are fundamentally entertainers, they also seek to build and foster communities of the disenfranchised. Much of the poetry is heavily stressed, metrically regular, and marked by extensive use of rhyme, alliteration, and assonance. Relying on quotidian language to speak of everyday life and often speaking in local idioms, dialects, or vernaculars (e.g., Lois-Ann Yamanaka's Hawaiian island pidgin poetry), the language of the class or cultural group to which the performance poet belongs becomes a political issue. Making theater out of social conflict and emphasizing the poem's status as speech act, the Spoken Word challenges our notions of what counts as \"literary.\")"@en .
